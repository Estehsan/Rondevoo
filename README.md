# Rondevoo Project

The website that offers 1 on 1 video calls. Meet live with celebrities, athletes, influencers, gamers... or with tutors, music instructors, chefs, coaches, and everyone in between. Anyone can be a creator, and anyone can be a user. A place for people to connect, learn, and inspire with others.

## QUICK START
To create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :

```
git clone https://github.com/Estehsan/Rondevoo.git
```
Go to the directory 
```
cd Rondevoo
```
Install the project 

- `yarn install` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn <platform>` to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device) 

If you're on a Mac and developing for iOS, you need to install the pods (via Cocoapods) to complete the linking.
